# Digital Value Frontend Challenge 

Welcome to the Digital Value Frontend Challenge! Thank for your interest in participating in our selection process.

## Goal

The objective is to implement a simple data visualization application that must display the evolution of online demand for a given selection of keywords. Online demand is measured using monthly search volumes in Google.

Each level of the challenge is based on top of the previous one, so you can leverage what you already did.

We don't expect you to be an expert designer, but we want to see if you're comfortable with web design principles to build a pleasant and performant user experience.

## Guidelines

- Clone the repo (do not fork it) and work on top of it
- Implement each level in ascending order (last two levels are optional)
- Commit at the end of each level
- Provide instructions to run each level of the challenge
- Host the highest level achieved of the challenge

## Rules

- Angular is preferred but React or Vue.js is also accepted
- Functional reactive programming is encouraged
- Use version control to deliver the test
- You can use any libs (JavaScript and CSS)

## What will be evaluated?

- Clean, robust and well-organized code (JavaScript and CSS)
- Compliance with guidelines
- Page layout and relevance of UX decision
- Friendly user interface

Let's get started! Go to [First level](level1)
