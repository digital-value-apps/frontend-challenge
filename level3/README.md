# Intro

We want to have a better indicator to understand the evolution of online demand. We could display the average monthly search volume and compare it to the average search volume for the last year.

# Level 3 - Calculate the average search volume

Let's calculate and display the average search volume of the selected category in the selected period and its year-on-year variation.

To present the variation, we calculate the percent variation of the year-over-year average using the formula: $variation = \frac{V_{new} - V_{old}}{V_{old}}$

Then go to [next level](../level4) (optional)
