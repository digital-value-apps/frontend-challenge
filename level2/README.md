# Intro

We want to have a better understanding of the online demand and navigate inside the category tree to refine the data displayed.

# Level 2 - Filtering by category

Implement a way to navigate inside the categories of the online demand.

The `GET /api/categories.json` endpoint returns the category tree and `GET /api/volumes/${id}.json` returns the monthly search volume a keyword category gets each month, over the last 48 months.

Then go to [next level](../level3)
