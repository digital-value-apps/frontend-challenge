# Intro

Restrict the application access to authorized users

# Level 4 - Authentication (optional)

Implement a very simple login page with a fake authentication system. There is no need to send the authentication request to a backend, you can hard code the login/password.
However, even if the authentication is faked, we would like to see how the application communicates authorization to the API to fetch the data.

We would like to know if you know the best practice for designing a secure authentication system.

Then go to [next level](../level5) (optional)
